This module contains a screen base class that handles screens that require
recursive directory scanning for files to be printed out.
See additional information in the class itself.

    A base class used to handle file reading, more specifically, multiple files
    retrieved from a `path` recursively. This also uses the `TypingHelperBase`
    helper class to add functionality of typing writer display.

    The instantiation of this class takes two additional arguments, compared
    with its base class:

        * `delay`: defines the speed of the typing writer. See more details
          of this in `TypingHelperBase` class documentation. Its value is
          defined by `TypingHelperBase`'s default, if none is informed.

        * `path`: defines the path from where this screen should scan
          for files

    When inheriting from this screen, you can also take advantage of the
    following properties and functionalities:

        * `cleanup_per_file`: forces to clean up the screen for each file in
          the looping. The alternative, available in
          `ScreenBase.cleanup_per_cycle`, only handles a cycle action.
